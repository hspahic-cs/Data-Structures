# Data Structures Course
A compilation of data structures &amp various CS concepts ( complexity, useful objects, etc.) I've worked on throughout
through-out college. Below is a list of all material covered.

######*Note - All code written in JAVA*

####Data Structures
* Stacks
* Queues
* Linked Lists (SLL)
* Binary Trees (btree)
* Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
* Treaps *(Implemented using BSTs)*
* Huffman Trees
* Hash Tables (hashes)

####Projects Completed
* Binary Numbers                       || *(Using ArrayLists & Arrays)*
* A simulated Rolodex (rolodex)        || *(Using 2 way LinkedLists)*
* An Anagram checker (anagrams)        || *(Using HashTables)*
* A simulated GroceryStore w/customers || *(Using LinkedLists & Queues)*


####Algorithms
* SelectionSort (Algorithms)
* BubbleSort (Algorithms)
* QuickSort (Algorithms)
* MergeSort (Algorithms)
* TreeTraversal (BSTs && HuffmanTree)

####Complexity
* Various examples of complexity analysis (complexity)
